1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,420
Let's take a look at the completed 2D platformer game.

2

00:00:03,420  -->  00:00:06,410
Here it's running full screen on my Windows PC.

3

00:00:06,410  -->  00:00:09,160
Here we see our playable character in the center,

4

00:00:09,160  -->  00:00:11,120
looks like a green pig character.

5

00:00:11,120  -->  00:00:14,740
We've got an enemy character off to the side there in that blue shell,

6

00:00:14,740  -->  00:00:17,840
create objects and different pickup objects around the world.

7

00:00:17,840  -->  00:00:20,580
The pickups look like little strawberries that you can get.

8

00:00:20,580  -->  00:00:23,120
We also see a tile-base level design with

9

00:00:23,120  -->  00:00:25,940
all these platform areas that we can walk around on,

10

00:00:25,940  -->  00:00:27,280
and at the top of the screen,

11

00:00:27,280  -->  00:00:29,760
we see the user interface with a Score,

12

00:00:29,760  -->  00:00:32,025
the Instructions, and a Restart button.

13

00:00:32,025  -->  00:00:33,660
Now the score starts at zero,

14

00:00:33,660  -->  00:00:37,920
but it'll go up by one each time I collect one of these pickups and

15

00:00:37,920  -->  00:00:42,560
the instructions are shown to help the user understand how to play using the arrow keys.

16

00:00:42,560  -->  00:00:44,560
After we collect the first strawberry,

17

00:00:44,560  -->  00:00:46,140
the use arrow keys will disappear,

18

00:00:46,140  -->  00:00:48,380
giving us a little bit more screen real estate so we

19

00:00:48,380  -->  00:00:51,045
can enjoy the tile-base level design.

20

00:00:51,045  -->  00:00:53,760
The restart button can be clicked at any time

21

00:00:53,760  -->  00:00:57,265
and restarts a fresh game session. Let's take a look at that.

22

00:00:57,265  -->  00:00:59,830
Here with my mouse, I can click the Restart button

23

00:00:59,830  -->  00:01:04,180
and our character disappears and restarts again.

24

00:01:04,180  -->  00:01:07,845
Let's take a look at the controls in the audio of the game.

25

00:01:07,845  -->  00:01:10,480
As I click Up Arrow, I can jump,

26

00:01:10,480  -->  00:01:12,720
and we hear a little pop sound as I jump

27

00:01:12,720  -->  00:01:15,840
up and a little sound as I land on the platform again.

28

00:01:15,840  -->  00:01:19,340
Then I can use the Right and the Left Arrow keys to walk around.

29

00:01:19,340  -->  00:01:20,880
When I collect this strawberry,

30

00:01:20,880  -->  00:01:23,600
we'll hear a little sound confirming I've gotten some points,

31

00:01:23,600  -->  00:01:26,675
and we'll see the score update in the user interface.

32

00:01:26,675  -->  00:01:30,855
Nice chime. I'll jump up and collect another one here.

33

00:01:30,855  -->  00:01:32,630
As I'm jumping around,

34

00:01:32,630  -->  00:01:34,130
you can see in the background,

35

00:01:34,130  -->  00:01:39,470
there's this sunset sky color and also the cloud.

36

00:01:39,470  -->  00:01:42,690
Each of those layers moves a little bit different

37

00:01:42,690  -->  00:01:46,500
than the way that the camera follows our character around the screen,

38

00:01:46,500  -->  00:01:48,850
so it gives a little bit of a depth effect,

39

00:01:48,850  -->  00:01:51,850
makes the level look a little bit more alive because

40

00:01:51,850  -->  00:01:56,985
that clouds slightly different has just a nice, smooth, polished effect.

41

00:01:56,985  -->  00:01:59,760
I can move that crate around as we saw before.

42

00:01:59,760  -->  00:02:02,355
In case you wanted to create some puzzles in the games,

43

00:02:02,355  -->  00:02:04,485
you'd be able to jump up on that,

44

00:02:04,485  -->  00:02:08,585
and the game also has complete win and loss conditions.

45

00:02:08,585  -->  00:02:11,890
Let's see how it would work. I'll click Restart again, and here,

46

00:02:11,890  -->  00:02:14,230
I'll try to capture some of

47

00:02:14,230  -->  00:02:17,570
the strawberries that we need but there's an enemy in my way here.

48

00:02:17,570  -->  00:02:19,050
Now, if I touch the enemy,

49

00:02:19,050  -->  00:02:20,190
I'll die and get reset.

50

00:02:20,190  -->  00:02:22,510
Let's say I tried to jump, but I didn't,

51

00:02:22,510  -->  00:02:23,730
and I hit the enemy,

52

00:02:23,730  -->  00:02:25,115
so I get reset there,

53

00:02:25,115  -->  00:02:26,730
or if as the player,

54

00:02:26,730  -->  00:02:30,725
you get stuck between two platforms and you fall down off the world,

55

00:02:30,725  -->  00:02:34,735
you also hit that red area there which kills you and gets you reset,

56

00:02:34,735  -->  00:02:38,190
so now the player has a clear path to collect all the strawberries,

57

00:02:38,190  -->  00:02:42,565
but also some tension created by the enemies and being able to fall off things,

58

00:02:42,565  -->  00:02:45,130
so we'll see how I'm able to play around

59

00:02:45,130  -->  00:02:48,790
the world and collect all of the different pickups.

60

00:02:48,790  -->  00:02:51,570
Hopefully, this time, I make it.

61

00:02:52,790  -->  00:02:56,810
I died that time. We'll try one more time here.

62

00:02:58,700  -->  00:03:02,390
This is a little tricky to get so I'll get a running start.

63

00:03:02,390  -->  00:03:05,650
Now, I'll be careful not to hit our enemy there.

64

00:03:07,690  -->  00:03:11,270
This is going to be the eighth one that I collect,

65

00:03:11,270  -->  00:03:12,590
and that'll be it for the old game.

66

00:03:12,590  -->  00:03:15,725
It should finish when I collect this last strawberry.

67

00:03:15,725  -->  00:03:18,650
The text at the top updates to you win.

68

00:03:18,650  -->  00:03:20,930
We can see our score is eight out of eight.

69

00:03:20,930  -->  00:03:22,730
Just to keep the graphics alive,

70

00:03:22,730  -->  00:03:25,010
I have the playable character,

71

00:03:25,010  -->  00:03:27,950
continue to breathe here in mid air as a victory,

72

00:03:27,950  -->  00:03:29,990
and the input is disabled.

73

00:03:29,990  -->  00:03:34,090
I'm not able to move around which is a nice confirming sign that the game is over.

74

00:03:34,090  -->  00:03:35,910
At any time, including now,

75

00:03:35,910  -->  00:03:40,120
the player can hit the restart button and be able to restart and play again.

76

00:03:40,120  -->  00:03:43,100
That's it. That's the complete game.
